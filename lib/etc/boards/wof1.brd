Well we did it folks!  But lets try to continue to find difficult things to do as a group, or this will all be for nothing.

subject: Dues
message:
Yes there are dues, but I haven't figured out how much they are.  I had it figured out for 11 people, but now we are down a few members so the dues have gone up per person.  There is cash in the treasury, but that is a reserve fund.
So, I'll try to figure that out at a later date.

On a side note, I am trying my hardest to come back to fiery for at least some amount of time, but I have been busier than...well, basically I just have no free time to speak of.

Keep plugging away, I'm always available by e-mail.  volare007@gmail.com

I just realized that myspace allows for the creation of groups.  Thus, the WoF now have a myspace group.  You can get to it by going here:
http://groups.myspace.com/weaversoffate

If you have issues getting to that page, then I can add you.  Right now it's set to public view and public join.  Uh, anyways, if you can't get to it, then add me as a friend.

http://www.myspace.com/volare007

Why do this?  Because I said so, now don't ask anymore questions!

Have a nice day,

Janara

Just let me know how much we need :)

subject: Estimated dues cost
message:
Okay, I don't really now how many people are around to pay these dues, but here's how much we need to have for each month.

The clan hall costs 35000 plat.  The dues are 10% of that cost per month.  So 35000X10%=3500 in dues.  And 3500X12=42000 per year.

So basically, this is how things are gonna work.  The dues need to be paid each month, so whoever is there to pay them will pay them.  If you come up short, then talk to me and I'll pull money out of the emergency fund.

A log will be kept of who pays what each month, so that credit will be given where credit is deserved.  Then, those who haven't paid will face severe penalties, and will perhaps have to cover someone who already paid their dues the month before.


Right now as I see it, 3500/month is not an outstanding sum considering that a certain thief I know can come up with that amount on his own in one sitting.  

I will also be paying my dues each month, so when you guys divide the 3500 amongst active members, then include me in the division.

Okay peeps, I'm out for now.  Keep it real, keep it hot, keep it fiery.

subject: Dues collected...
message:
   All dues have been paid to me thus far, and the next payments are due some
time before January 5, 2007.  If all payments have not been given by that time,
then I will pull out of clan funds again to cover your sorry butts.  We all
need to come up with a time where we can all get on at the same time.  I have
no idea how this will work, so someone else more clever than I needs to come up
with the appropriate time.  Yeah, so anyways...  Put up your ideas on the
board.

subject: Slight Mistake
message:
   Uh, my mistake.  We have 9 "active" members instead of 8, thus dues are of
course a little less.  Recalculated at of course 390 instead of 440.  Whoop dee
freakin' doo.  So a small discount will be extended to you all on the next
payment.  Yes, that means that next time you only owe us 340 instead of 390 or
440.  Then after the next payment you'll owe the traditional 390.

subject: periodically meetings
message:
Hello all,I was talking with Janara the other day about how cool it was when we got all together to kill those dudes from 9 hells, and how cool it will be to meet up periodically to be able to do such brave things again.
The thing is what's the point of the clan if we don't act like a clan. Just pay our dues? At least that's not what i have in mind.
So, my proposal (which of course is to be disscused, modified or changed for another one) is why don't we set up a meeting let's say the second sunday of each month, at about the same time that we met for killing the 9 hells dudes (that time is not that l
late for me to be able to assist ;))
and we could do some fun stuff together.
For example, as Kourrya being part of the clan, we could ask her do create special quests for us (with special rewards :P) or to open 9 hells or doom or whatevr thing we want.
I believe that meeting once a month is a reasonable request, plus it shoud be fun.
Please give it a thought and please do comment.
best wishes,
Mecke

Yeah, this is depressing alright.  Nobody's here.  Noone, nothing.  Perhaps if you all would tell me a good time to get together to chat and go kill shit, then things would be more exciting.
Just an idea...

message:
   Yeah, I don't know what's going on with this clan, but it seems that nobody
gets on much less checks this board.  So, I am going to talk to the gods about
reducing our costs by cutting a few items from our clan hall.  Mostly the
bulletin boards.  And then I will ask about getting a clan forum on the
website.  If anyone has any problems with this, feel free to whine/bitch to me
