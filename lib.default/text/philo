The origional vision of FieryMUD was to create a challanging MUD for
advanced players. This new reborne Fiery is a hope to bring back the goals
of the past by inflicting certain death on unsuspecting players...  FieryMUD
will continue to grow and change through the coming years and those players
who seek challange and possess imagination will come in search of what
the 3D world fails to offer them.... (see the command CREDITS)

The areas and regions of FieryMUD will have a consistency of geography and a
maturity of juxtaposed crisis which integrates to form overall themes.  This
is not to say that some crisis can not exist within a region and be
completely oblivious to a global concept but this will be rare.  In fact
existing fiery areas that have a stand alone nature will more than likely
have some device added to them to lend, in most cases subtly, to a regional
or global theme.

Some gound rules:

This is not a smurf mud - If you are hot for smurfs delete yourself now.

No blatant copying of existing ideas, concepts, stories, pantheons, etc.. -
Don't get me wrong, the use of existing archetypes can and will be crucial
in the development of areas.  Civilization has only been around for a
kabillion years so most every possible crisis has already occured in some
archetypal fashion already.  If anyone notices this happening, the blatant
copying, let me know.  We should be able to dilute a story in such a way to
lend a soft subtlty to it and not slap anyone in the face with where it came
from to badly...
