*NOTICE*
This board is for the council members only.  Everything on this board will be discussed during the monthly meeting, and will be cleared after the meeting.

Nobody except a council member should ever post on this board period.  If you have something you want to discuss during a meeting, talk to a council member, and he/she will post it on here.

Seriously, break this rule and you're Mysa feed.

Clan Titles
I propose that we reduce the number of titles from 8 to 3.  It would work something like this.

Rank 3: Weaver of Balance  (Neutral Leader)
Rank 2: Weaver of Choice   (1 good/1 evil elder or advisor both with same title)
Rank 1: Weaver of Fate     (all other members)

Names are subject to change if someone has a better idea.



Clan Dues
I propose that we get rid of the bulletin boards, and purchace a clan forum on www.fierymud.org.  This would save us 300 platinum per month.  3600 per year.


Clan Hall
There are a few things I'd like to change in the clan hall that are mostly aesthetic in nature.
I'm preparing a propsoal to the gods, and if anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear them.


I'll have more to post later.
