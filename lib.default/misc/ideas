Laich    (Mar 13) [ 1299] perhaps make a help file for "ptell":)

Laich    (Mar 13) [ 4002] Need to make paper in the mud again:)
Laich    (Mar 14) [ 4003] The idea of a mob desc saying that it forces me to step back (in terror i suppose) wasnt thought out that well. Perhaps an alternative is an order:) *just a thought*
Laich    (Mar 14) [ 4003] One more thing, 48805 A mighty blue dragon roars when it sees you! Doesnt apply to every situation, seeing when a rogue or theif is in sneak and hide mode. Doesnt make sense the dragon can see you:)

Azkrael  (Aug 31 2008) [ 1299] I think the vwear helpfile could use some elaboration for the gt/lt, gte/lte, bt and all that fun stuff.

Venath   (Sep 08 2008) [50002] Az, you know that these ideas don't go to Mantis right?  *poke*
Azkrael  (Sep 10 2008) [58060] helpfile for the structure types.
Azkrael  (Sep 10 2008) [58060] Make that: need a helpfile for the different types of sectors.
Venath   (May 12 2009) [ 3034] Can we make the bug/typo/idea submission either have a higher buffer, or make it similar to the board/mail posting system. So that we don't have any orphaned issues on mantis.
