bigby wizard shopkeeper~
Bigby~
Bigby walks around behind the counter, muttering powerful incantations.
~
Bigby looks to be very old, but he is far from senile.  The raw magical power
that emanates from him is almost frightening, but he seems to be somewhat less
than concerned by the likes of you.  Best to not make him notice you - just buy
what you came in for and then leave him alone.

Helena~
Helena smiles brightly at you as she prepares another batch of donuts.

A bright happy woman. She looks like she's found her calling and one
taste of her donuts should be enough to prove it to you too! She may
be a baker now, but her weathered skin and excellent body tone reveal
her tougher side.

very set in her ways. She's one of those people who believes that the
old methods are still the best, and always will be. Her gruff manner
doesn't exactly give you a warm, fuzzy feeling either.

Dressed for the weather, it is clear that this man has no business but that of
the most vile sort.  Though he stands as still as a tree himself, his eyes
betray the true hunter inside.  Everywhere there is light there is darkness.  
And this man is the proof that evil lurks in the shadows.  Even to the
untrained eye, he is obviously of the type you don't cross.  Hopefully
your business with him will be brief.  It is doubtful that he will pay
attention to you anyways unless he has business with you.

julk-mercenary-trainer~
Julk~
Julk the mercenary trainer leans against the wall, looking for new clients.
~
   Though he comes only halfway up the doorframe, this halfling almost
resembles a dwarf, with his deep chest, and square shoulders.  With one hand,
he tosses a dagger, catching it by the blade to pass the time.  With the other
hand, he keeps a light hand on his purse.  He's always on the lookout for
opportunities to add to it.  Perhaps he has something to offer you..

calken trainer warrior~
Calken~
An experienced old warrior is training town guards and adventurers alike.
~
   Calken's dwarven beard is almost entirely grey, leaving only a trace of it's
youthful red.  He is shorter than any human in the room, but from the width of
his shoulders and the depth of his chest, you imagine he is as strong as half
of them combined.

Fecil~
Fecil is here conjuring an elemental for his pupil to engage.
~
   Fecil is standing here twirling his long twisted black hair, pale skin
stretched across his tall boney frame.  He seems to have a mischevious and
creepy essence about him.  He talks in a low whisper in a crackely voice fit
for a man of old age.  How old is this man?  Has he somehow prolonged his life
using magic or is he an un-aging man?
