The little doll is sewn together from scraps of cloth.  Facial features are
stitched carefully on the head, depicting a mischevious smile.  Something about
the doll just makes you want to pat it on the head!  A hooded cloak made of
brown felt fits the doll nicely, covering the seams where the arms are
attached.  Each arm has an odd little sword sewn on--the hilts are metallic,
but the blades are a strange glowing material.  The swords' glow slowly
alternates between subtle brightening and dimming, casting varying shadows on
the doll's face which seem to make its eyes come alive.

This little avian doll is covered in actual rich, deep red feathers from a
rosella.  Its beauty could easily be mistaken for a blossoming flower, albeit a
flower with a large wooden hookbill.  Little wooden feet stick out of the
bottom, but don't seem to serve very well for balance, as the doll has trouble
standing up.

doll miniature-zalkar-doll tiny-demon-lord~
Summoned here either by a powerful wizard or a talented doll-maker, you wonder
what foul purpose was intended in summoning this Zalkar doll.  It has magma red
skin, and an evil look in its eyes.  Such a doll couldn't be intended as an
agent of evil, but it could hardly be meant as a plaything for children.

This doll only marginally resembles the average forest deer, for it has jet

Welcome to Fiery Mud!
 
Here you will learn powerful new spells and skills that will enable you 
to venture ever further into this strange new world...
Power and riches beyond your wildest dreams could become yours -
if you have what it takes!

This pamphlet will guide you along your first steps on Fiery.
It is meant to keep you from making the same mistakes newbies have been 
making time after time. Some of this might not be new to you, other 
things are specific to Fiery.
 
Here are some helpful tips to get you going, type "look <tip>":
	COMMANDS -> A list of helpful commands.
	FIGHTS   -> A brief summary over fighting.
	LEVELING -> A brief summary about advancing and guilds.
	RENTING  -> A brief summary about leaving Fiery, and misc things.
        RULES    -> A quick list of Fiery rules.
        MAP      -> A map of Mielikki.
	CLOSING  -> Final advice and if you have questions.
NOTE: All bold words within these 5 subtopics are commands that can be typed.
~
E
tip tips~
Type one of the following:
   Look commands
   Look fights
   Look leveling
   Look renting
   Look rules
   Look map
   Look closing
~
E
commands command~
Before you get started in your adventures, we ask that you do a little
reading to help you understand Fiery's environment and how things work.
Please be patient, reading all of this should take you less then
5 minutes.

Here are a few of things we strongly advise you to read, type:
HELP -> A list of all the major commands.
HELP NEWBIE -> Brief newbie advice on areas to try. 
HELP RULES -> A listing of Fiery Mud's rules.
HELP AREAS -> A list of current areas and their respective levels.
HELP KILLER -> A brief warning about attacking players.
HELP 100 -> A list of the limitations for immortals and gods.
NEWS -> A list of all the mud's changes <Not necessary to read immediately>.
~
E
fights fight~
After you've read the rules, you might feel the urge to KILL something.
There's a large field just outside the west gate that's pretty safe,
especially if you first CONSIDER the creatures you want to kill.
Killing creatures will earn you experience points, and sometimes gold.
Remember that you can GET ALL from the corpse, and TAP the corpse when 
you're done, to tidy things up.
~
E
leveling levels level~
Try typing SCORE. When you have earned enough experience points, you will 
be ready to level. This is done at your guild, by typing LEVEL GAIN. It 
might be a good idea to visit your guild right away, for this is also the 
place where you can PRACTICE new skills or spells. Guilds can be found 
close to the town center. Monks and Rangers can level at the Warrior's
Guild. All the other classes must level in their respective guilds.
~
E
renting rent quitting quit~
Should you get hungry, there's a bakery on North Commerce Avenue.  There are
also many other ways of creating and/or finding food about the realm.  
Currently renting at the inn is free, with a limit on 50 items per player to
reduce any problems that could occur.  To view your current load you may use
the offer command at the inn.  Camping is also another alternative, and can be
done in any outdoors room.  It is free, and allows you to stay far away from
town if you haven't completed your current adventure.  Typing QUIT is possible
but NOT something you should generally do, for you will lose all of your
equipment.    
~
E
rules~
FieryMud has a few simple rules. For a fairly complete listing of rules, 
type: h rules -- but be aware that this list can change without notice. 
ALL PLAYERS are expected to know the rules.

  You should definitely read the altar board for more information, as well
as the news, at some point. All players are expected to know what is
contained therein!

closing~
First off we'd like to thank you for taking the time and reading this
pamphlet. If you have any questions, my advice to you would be:

First ->  check to see if there is a HELP file available, by typing
          help <keyword>
Second -> type WHO and look for a higher level player, and politely
          ask them if they'd answer your question using the TELL command.
Third ->  Ask your question politely over the GOSSIP channel, but please
          don't spam GOSSIP with your question over and over if you do not
          receive an answer.

By the way, the ECHOBACK command will enable you to see what you're 
saying. Everything else you would want to know can be found in the HELP 
files - or ask your fellow players, if you're really stuck.
 
Now, we wish you good luck! 
Get on the road to Immortality...
Good hunting!
