CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

CircleMUD is available for anonymous FTP at ftp.circlemud.org in
/pub/CircleMUD.  Its author can be contacted at jelson@circlemud.org.

HubisMud was developed origionaly by Todd Avans and Ben Horner
in the aftermath of untold sins committed on the mudding community
by the wasteland that became the Sojourn spinoffs and their wizards.

	HubisMud also developed by:
				   Steve Smith
				   Tim Holcomb
				   Josh Larsen

From which many hair pulling hours were spent putting up with Banyal.
It is their hope to create a fair and playable balanced environemnt
that would produce hours of effort to enjoy not destroy. To this end
I wish them well. - Zzur

FieryMUD was origionally based on copper gamma and completly concept
initiated, hosted, coded and Implemented by Chris Camacho as this c
coding project that just went awry.  He'd no idea some psychos would
actually like it and play there all the time.  As a result of his 
efforts in the face of an 'all frills or bust' mudding community he
quietly kept running one of the oldest Diku muds on the internet.

It has only taken massive hardware failure to allow Scott Davis a 
crack at vaguely more modern code to allow FieryMUD interim possession
of a different and challanging player interface.  The origional vision
of FieryMUD was to create a challanging MUD for advanced players.
This new reborne Fiery is a hope to bring back the goals of the past
by inflicting certain death on unsuspecting players...  FieryMUD will
continue to grow and change through the coming years and those players
who seek challange and possess imagination will come in search of what
the 3D world fails to offer them....
