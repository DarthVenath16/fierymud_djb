If you play here, you agree totally to abide by these policies.

* Abusing the system or the few rules we have makes the administrators of
  this mud very unhappy. Unhappy admins do things culprits won't like.
  We do not play reindeer games with "but what if I do THIS..." We are
  believers in the concept of "the spirit of the law".

* Abusing the system's ADMINISTRATORS, of course, is instant death.
  If you choose to believe this means you must brown-nose, that's your
  problem. If an admin requests you do or not do something, you will
  comply immediately. If you disagree with the request, you have the
  right to take the matter to a higher god... after you comply.

* Your presence on this game is not a right. Just as you can leave this
  game anytime you want, your invitation to play can be revoked anytime
  WE want. For any reason.

* Administrators of this game will, for their part, act under a provision
  of non-interference. We assure you we will not take out agendas or any
  frustrations upon players, although this also means that we will not
  render any divine assistance to them, either (see HELP 100).
