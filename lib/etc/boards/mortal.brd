Alrighty folks... here's the rundown as best I can recall
from a host of threads on the forums... AND the manual I had
rewritten back in 2k2

Requirements:
* You must have at least a minimum of 5 charter members
&0    Founders need to be active, if ever they become inactive then
&0    a replacement founder must be chosed before dues are collected
&0    or face disbandment.

* Guilds must have a charter of guiding principles and reason for
&0    existing.  This should include races, classes, alignment
&0    restrictions as well as goals of the guild, rules/laws
&0    and so forth.

* All guild members must be at least level twenty-five (25) or over.

- Fees and Dues -

* Initial setup is 15K platinum for starting the guild.
&0    The initial fee inclues a building permit for a 
&0    two (2) room hall of the the guild's design and local.
&0    (Some restrictions may apply)

* Additional rooms are 3k platinum each

* Guild Bulletin Board is 2k platinum

* Private forums section is 3k platinum

* Furnishings are 1.5k platinum per miscellaneous object.

* Water fountain is 2k platinum

* Shop (with 4 basic items) is 7k platinum
&0    (2k per additional item)

* Inn or rentability within the hall is 8K platinum

* Guild equipment is as follows:
&0    - 3k platinum per basic item.
&0    - 5k platinum per +1 improved ability
&0    - 7k platinum per +1 improved ac
&0    - 12k platinum per +1 charge of x spell

&0    (equipment must be modeled after items commonly found throughout
&0    the realms, excluding deity or quest items and no equipment should
&0    retain permenant ability such as stoneskin, sneak, hide, haste, etc)

Dues are calculated by taking 10% of the overall guild construction cost
including extra rooms, items, etc. and are to be paid by the 5th of
every month.  Any guild that fails to pay their dues will have sixty
(60) days to pay the balance in full or have their guild disbanded
and any personal guild effects confiscated.

Ok, the realms have gotten a little richer.

So, this means clans should be able to afford their dues now
so long as they maintain a base of active players to contriubute
to the clan's overall wealth and benefit.

Btw, happy Cinco de Mayo... now where are my dues?!?!

message:
I must admit, I've tried a few other muds recently, including Jedimud which was created by Jeremy Elson, the author of circlmud, and I have come to the conclusion that Fiery is one of the best muds out there.

One of the best things about fiery are the room descriptions.  I checked out batmud, which has a religious following of about 400-500 players at any given time, and I didn't even like it.  I couldn't understand the room descriptions.

Another great thing about fiery is the never ending story.  Most of the old players from around here are still learning things about this MUD.  Most muds have a story that just ends with the character winning, which is totally lame.

The purpose of this post is to just thank the gods for doing such a great job, and to point out that those who whine, bicker, complain, etc...really, get a life, or get off the MUD.

I will try to keep this short. Rick (Pergus, of course) was our friend and my mentor for
many years. He was there to hear my heart-song of hardship when no one else seemed to listen.
We confided much in one another about our lives from mudding, relationships, and mysteries
of life. He committed a great deal of his time to us and you helping Fiery stay on its feet
and enjoyed all the fruits of his work, respect, and friendship that it bestowed. He is a
great deal more to me than just a friend as I'm sure he was to most of you, I called him
brother.

Although his life was cut short I know his spirit can never be far from us and those he loved.
He was a good father and husband, a dedicated man to a long forgotten cause and we should all
have a moment of silence and prayer for his soul and family. We keep those we care about in
our memories regardless of the sadness it may bring because this is how they are never forgotten.
Do not forget this man or the care he provided and joy he brought to us all, for as long as
you remember he will always be with us until we meet again in the next stage of life.

Good wishes my brother, you will always be whole-heartedly missed.

subject: Official Remort Rules
message:
Please note that as of right now, there are very few people who can actually
start you on one of these quests, so it may take a while for a request to be processed.
 
Rules for Remort
 
Qualifying for Remorting
Any persons looking to remort must fit the following qualifications.
1) One remort char will be allowed for each person at the following intervals:
4 completed chars, one of each base class type
9 completed chars
14 completed chars
17 completed chars, meaning one of each class (at this stage the only restriction
is that only 1 char may remort at a time).  By "completed", it means a **
character with all possible quest spells (if applicable, obviously an
assassin doesn't have quest spells).
 
2) The questee must prove their knowledge of the realm by answer 10 mud
knowledge questions from a list of 100. These will be randomly chosen and
given after verfication of other qualifications.
 
3) The char that shall be remorted must have a minimum of 2 weeks (336 hours).
Playtime with all other "completed" chars is a minimum of 100 hours playtime.
 
4) Must not have any outstanding quests on any chars. You may not start new
spell/eq quests while one of your characters is on a remort quest, except
spell quests for the remort character.
 
 
Remort Rules
1) A grouping restriction of no more than 5 levels above the remorting char
shall remain in effect. This includes help of any kind such as transportion
such as moonwells and CR such as res and shift corpse and support such as
invis, stone etc... However, feel free to group with those within the accepted
level range, which includes all characters of lower level than the remort.
 
2) To be considered "completed" in regards to the remort the char must re-quest
for and complete ALL possible spell quests. (Quests are considered part of
leveling up a char and thus must be completed during remort as well.)
 
Failure to comply with these rules will be a demotion back to level 1 and no
benifits upon regaining ** status. In other words, failing to respect these
rules is failing to respect the remort quest and result in revoke of the priviledge.
 
Reward for a Successfully Completed Remort
The character will be given:
 
1) All maxed stats.
 
2) All maxed skills for their class. Spells must be re-quested for as noted
in the Rules section.
 
3) 50% additional HP (based on their L99 hp before maxed stats and without
eq). This means that if you have 950 as a ** without eq before remorting,
your bonus would be 475 for a new total of 1475 (assuming you rolled the
same amount of hp the second time through).
 
4) The person shall be given access to the evil races choices for their next
char set. You may still quest for evil characters in the usual way, but this
is an added bonus for completing the remort quest.
 
 
 
If there are any questions, please contact your local Deity for more information.

subject: RE: Be Nice to the Lowbies
message:
1.  Yes, there are several people on this mud who are, without reason, rude beyond all measure.
This unfortunately is a fact of life, and if they suck, don't talk to them.
2.  There are very, VERY few actual new players left on this mud.  This is more a general statement than
a response to the previous post, but it is important for us old players to remember when interacting with
people who are under, oh let's say, level 25.
3.  There's very little friendliness because players are not shown a reason to BE friendly.
Certain people are very, very mean and it perpetuates this problem.  However, you too can help this
situation - when someone tells you something, or especially when someone gives you instruction,
perform this action to the t and do NOT continue to whine.  Whining is the real problem.  I will admit
that EVERYONE in this mud, with one or two very specific exceptions, whines a lot.  A couple people
whine a WHOLE lot though, and this brings me to my actual point - if you are being perceived as
whiny and incompatent, you will be promptly ignored.  This goes for characters of ALL levels, not
just newbies.
4.  Like our dear Lord of Fire used to say, if your character is of an evil alignment, class or race,
this does NOT give you a liscense to be a jerk, talk crap, and treat other people like dirt.  This is
not roleplaying, that's just being a jerk and falsely claiming you have a right to behave as such.
I apologize for letting this get really long, but there are some things here that have needed to be said
for a while now.

well said cerworn. I should add if someone gives u help with a few levels/eq or something like that dont keep bugging them for more.
ive helped a few people and all they wanted was me to hold there hand and do everything for them.
Ill help when i can but like cerworn pointed out if theres constant whinning ill wont help out. ask once or maybe twice and someone should help out.
theres a few people i know who would help out alot dont be afraid to ask but dont push it.

message:
Without specific examples, Conchend's advice is not very useful.
I know one kind of newbie activity that brings out the worst in
me is when they ask stuff they should be achieving on their
own. For example, you should not be asking "Where is the Dairy
Farm". You should be finding it.  Same goes for nearly any
area. Fiery's not that big.

On the other hand, if someone needs a CR, it is very bad manners
to taunt them about it and do nothing.  Ignoring newbies who
need CRs is rude too (not helping oldbies is bad form but not
quite so bad).  Of course, if you need help, you DO need to
ask for it.  Just saying "I died" is not enough.

OK guys, I havn't seen a lot of this problem.  Remember, the spirit of this game is to explore, and find things on your own
if you ask for help, My thought is that, you should get a HINT, not a 'go 3 west, and kill the wild boar' -- honestly, I don't see the fun in it, if you just get the instructions, and go do it.  

there are times I've been stuck, and I've had a variety of people off to help me.  I don't think I've ever had anyone turn me away, or ignore me, but I don't constantly ask for help, and I certainly don
't insult the gods, and tell them they have been doing things wrong all along.

I'm also puzzled by some who claim to have been here before, but didn't know certain areas of the game are HIGH LEVEL, and should not bypass the things in place to keep lowbies out.   then complain when they die. I believe things would have gone much easi

subject: Power Level!
message:
I was taken aback by an event that took place Sunday evening.  Brunir achieved his ** status, and exclaimed how proud he was of his accomplishment over 
gossip. When he wasn't immediately congratulated he started prompting praise 
from those of us who were on the mud.  When he finally got the praise he 
desired he then told us of how "difficult" those 2 days and 2 hours were to
master the mud.

I felt it was disgusting that one player had "beaten" the mud in 50 hours, and
expected us to acknowledge his accomplishment with praise.  As if he had 
accomplished something worthwhile.  What was more disturbing is that this seems 
to be the norm on the mud as someone gossiped, 'earning a rank on this mud is 
so rare and so unpopular we don't even discuss it any more.'

I would disagree with Petree who gossiped, 'getting a ** is worthy of gratz, no 
matter how you get it.'   It is my firm belief that true sacrifice and 
accomplishment is worthy of praise, but when you cheat yourself and the system, 
then you have accomplished nothing, and deserve nothing.

So is this the norm?  What are other player's feelings on the topic?  If you 
are a ** and you earned every level through hard work, how would you feel if 
someone was power-leveled and expected the same recognition as you?  How many 
players have a character who was power-leveled?  Do you think any differently 
about power-leveled characters?

In answer to your questions, I despise and abhor pleveling.  I will never understand as long as I live, why people come on a game, and refuse to play it.  What is the fun in that.They will stand around and gossip and drive others crazy trying to get a 
higher level group to take them out for levels.
I rarely get asked anymore.  I have 24 characters (about) and none have been pleveled.  Narak has been thru twice and second time had to solo all
the way.  Course she gets a lot of help from her minions.  They changed
the rules before I remorted, so I set up a deal with Eone that we would go
at the same time so we could group.
I must say that playing with Eone and having to stay within a couple of levels of each other has been great fun, and certainly lots of laughs.
Hardest part is people want to help us, but we cannot accept help from any
one higher then 5 levels above us without losing our prospective prize.
Some have been hard to convince.  Players tend to really be nice and help
each other a lot.
each other a lot.
Enough maundering.  But it is good to have a chance to air my opinion.
Thanks Lolindir, and I still love your name.

message:
well I am Petree's brother, and think my message was taken out of context.reply what I said was anyone who gets **'s is worthy of gratz, even if they 
powerleveled all the way to **, it still took effort, and at least some knowledge
of the mudd.

NOW-- that said, I don't like p-leveling all that much myself, and prefer to do it the hard way.
I really do think that people that get 1 or 2 **'s then use them to p-level 
all their other chars, are losing a lot of how the different characters play
and how the different combinations of characters can be used.
Also, with all the new areas in the mudd, you miss playing them as they were
meant to be played with appropriate level characters.

I have said before, to each his own, and play how you like, so
for those that want to p-level, that's all your choice, but I would encourage . 
everyone to play the game the way it was meant to be played at some point.
if you havn't done it in a while, you should try!
I have a ton of fun with my low-lev chars.  you should too!

I love p-leveling, because i play for my characters and to wear neat stuff.  I
kknow that most people think I'm wrong and gross, but I don't care.  I also
don't think I deserve praise when I get a character to ** because I KNOW I
haven't put in as much work as, say, Suraki did.  If you actually struggle
through each level and gain your stars without any serious assistance, then
that's great!  Good job to you!  But don't expect people to cowtow to you
because you ran through BFT, Nordus, GY or where ever for two days and hit the
last level.  Getting to ** does NOT mean you know much, if anything, about the
game, and doing it over and over doesn't prove anything other than you now
where to find one or more of the zones I just listed.

So enough rant from me, a notorious pleveler.

subject: re: Powerleveling
message:
I have no strong opinions one way or the other about power-levelinga character except for the fact that you are only cheating yourself.
By cheating yourself I do not mean by powerleveling your 3rd rogue
up to ** (as you have played the class through by yourself already)
but rather I mean you lose the experience of actually PLAYING the
game as the character you pleveled in the first place.

I do note that I do not understand logging on, getting ** in 50 hours,
then claiming the game is stupid and pointless and super-easy. As
others have pointed out a few quick jaunts thru BFT, GY, etc can get
your **s in no time.  If you truly explore the land and get a feel for
the rich story and history of the realm then I have no problem if you
plevel yourself to death. (Though what joy people get from only 
typing "kill alligator" over and over I will never understand).  As far
as players like Tavsan go, sure they plevel, but he also has a fairly
rich knowledge of the realm.  If you want to ** yourself before you
risk going to explore, grand, but at ** you will never feel the same
thrill in Lava as someone in their 30s.

Of course, I suppose this is the reason the imms put hour 
requirements on some of their quests and the reason they ask
various forms of trivia and "go collect this" kind of quests which
involve the far-flung sections of the realm.  I really do feel badly
for people who are so "accomplished" at their ** but even once 
there do not realize that they are missing the whole game while
they get there.

And not to pick on the ** rogues out there, but, well, there are SO
many cooler classes and even subclasses to rogue!

i have cheated and weasels my whole way up to the top.by top i mean by no means that my chars are spectacular, but
hitting ** doesnt make a char complete. most chars can quest
for something, and fighters should know were there eq comes
from more than anyone else, because eq makes the difference
between good and crappy players(and of course, the knowledge/
skill behind it).
i definetly agree, that i have missed out on 70% of the mud.
because i didnt take the time to enjoy the ingame quests and such
ive had alot of fun with my little monk, because dispite my 
best efforts hes still a lowbee, and its still tuff for him.
i played him up to 20 or more without assisting with any other chars of mine
before i lost will power. he still does lots on his own. my plvling
is not usualy to get someone to **. its just to move things along, so i dont have to kill
smugglers for weeks. 
im deffinetly a fan of occational minor plvling, and such, but keep

hey all. well i cant honestly say i didnt plevel here and there. i did it to a certain level then solo'd the char.as for brunir to get ** well good for him clearing out nordus all time. that deserves such big praise to do that. theres moe to this game then pleveling.
if i plevel a char i try some whacky/insane stuff bourderline suicidal stuff sometimes for kicks and to kill bordem here and there.
ill have to say everyone is so into going to noruds and bf all the time to plevel chars. theres more to the game then that.
you would know theres better areas to level then there if u explore, and its fun to find stuff out on a area on your own.
erm gives me crap when i dont tell him something he should know, calling me rude, but when he's asking for help he cries cause noone gives him any.
if your ** u should know alot about the game. theres still lots of stuff i need to learn ill admit that, but i know just enough to get around good.
for suraki and others that play the game like the gods want to they do deserve big praise and rewards to do that. more people need to do that.
if u cant do that well play something else. if u do it once u can do it again. look at cylor when he remorted. took him about a mounth.

subject: Name Rules
message:
Clearly there is need of the name rules to be written somewhere more evident
than that which are already written on the character creation screen.  So here
are all the reasons why we may choose to delete you because of your name.

Your name may not contain any of the following.

1. Compound words. Examples: LadyJade, BraveBlade, ImmortalSoul
 These types of names give a player an unearned arrogance above
 other players and in some instances above the gods.
2. Offensive words or names, mispelled or backwards. Eg: Sgurd Kcuf Emod
3. Names from known mythos, movies etc... Examples: Feyd, Conan, Zeus
 Come on, you can be more creative than reliance on an existing known
 character.
4. Names that do not fit the character you are playing. Examples:
 A human named Gruzel
 A troll named Bob
 A boy named Sue
 An orc named Ripenthiel
5. No offensive words or names from other languages or cultures.
6. No Nouns verbs or adverbs. Eg. Jester, Red, Dog, Bloody, Hotly, Freedom
 Pervert, PC, Trouble, McIntosh, Desperado.  Sorry guys LAME.
7. No names that resemble common nouns verbs or adverbs. Eg. Jesterx,
 Redx, Chamelion, Desperato etc...
8. No modern names. Examples: Rina John Mike Steve
No one.

Names that violate these rules will be dealt with when we see them.
